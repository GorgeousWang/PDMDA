# fork notes
we obtain the miRNA–disease association dataset, including 546 miRNAs, 333 diseases and 6077 miRNA–disease associations. 

=======================================================================================================
Welcome to use PDMDA algorithm. PDMDA is a novel and effective computational model for predicting deep-level miRNA-disease association.
